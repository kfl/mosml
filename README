This is file README for Moscow ML 2.10 for Linux/Unix (August 2013)

EXTENT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION

The current version 2.10 of Moscow ML

    * implements the full Standard ML language, as revised 1997, 
      including Modules and some extensions
    * yet is backwards compatible with versions prior to 2.00
    * implements large parts of the new SML Basis Library
    * implements separate compilation 
    * can produce compact stand-alone executables (a la Caml Light)
    * supports quotations and antiquotations, useful for metaprogramming
    * supports dynamic linking of external functions under Linux (x86
      and Alpha), FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Digital Unix, HP-UX,
      MacOS, and MS Windows'95/98/NT/XP/Vista and possibly also 7 and 8. 

New in version 2.10 of Moscow ML

  * Support for dynamic linking and callback from C also under MacOS X
  * There may now be 2 G globals (string literals etc) instead of 64 K
  * Bugs fixed:
    * The HTML files generated for mosmllib now have valid URLs
    * Substring.app more efficient
    * Recursive structure compilation (elabRecSigExp) fixed
    * Several errors in Mosmlcookie
    * Misplaced double quote in Msp.ahrefa 
    * Exception Option wasn't available at top-level
    * Linker did not check stamps of linked-in units
    * Hash function now much faster on very long strings
    * Double alignment constraints now correct with gcc-3.2 and Solaris
    * Bug in Polyhash.filter
    * Socket library returned only first 16 bytes of UDP datagram
  * SML Basis Library changes:
    * String and Substring: added concatWith, isSuffix, isSubstring, full
    * ListPair: added zipEq, appEq, mapEq, foldlEq, foldrEq, allEq
    * Added ArraySlice and VectorSlice structures, also for Char and Word8
    * Added find, findi, all, exists, collate to vector, array and 
      slice structures
    * Added collate to List
    * Added update to vector structures
    * Path.{mkRelative,mkAbsolute} now take record arguments
    * Negative Time.time values allowed
    * OS.Process: new functions sleep and isSuccess; status not eqtype
    * Listsort: added eqclasses, merge, mergeUniq
    * Path: added functions isRoot, fromUnixPath, toUnixPath, and
      exception InvalidArc (bug report by Henning Niss)
    * TextIO: inputLine now have type instream -> string option
    * Array: added type abbreviation vector (bug report by Andrzej
      Wasowski)
    * FileSys: type access renamed to access_mode (bug report by
      Henning Niss)
    * Byte: unpackString{,Vec} now uses vector slices (bug report by
      Henning Niss)
    * Unix: added functions fromStatus, textInstreamOf, binInstreamOf,
      textOutstreamOf, binOutstreamOf, exit, and added phantom types
      to proc (bug report by Henning Niss)
    * Timer: added function checkCPUTimes
    * Word and Word8: added functions toLarge, toLargeX, and fromLarge
      (bug report by Martin Elsman)
    * General: added exception Span and made the type of the function
      'before' less general (bug report by Henning Niss)
  * Added modules to mosmllib:
    * Buffer: mutable string buffers for fast and efficient
      concatenation of strings
    * Hashset: sets implemented by hash-tables
    * Rbset: ordered sets implemented by red-black trees
    * Redblackmap: maps implemented by red-black trees
  * Moscow ML is now developed in the open at github.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Compilation under Unix is best done using GNU make, gcc, and Perl.  A
binary installation requires 8 MB disk space; a source installation
requires 25 MB disk space.

Moscow ML owes much to:
    * the CAML Light implementation by Xavier Leroy and Damien Doligez
      (INRIA, Rocquencourt, France); especially the Caml Light bytecode
      generator and the runtime system;
    * the ML Kit by Lars Birkedal, Nick Rothwell, Mads Tofte and David Turner
      (Copenhagen University, Denmark, and Edinburgh University, Scotland);
    * inspiration from the SML/NJ compiler developed at Princeton
      University and AT&T Bell Laboratories, New Jersey, USA; 
    * the good work by Doug Currie, Flavors Technology, USA, on the
      MacOS port and many improvements; and
    * feedback, contributions, and useful suggestions, in particular
      from Jonas Barklund, Mike Gordon, Michael Norrish, Konrad Slind,
      Jakob Lichtenberg, Hans Molin, and numerous other people.
